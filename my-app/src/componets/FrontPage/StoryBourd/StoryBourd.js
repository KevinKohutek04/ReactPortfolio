            Back in 2019, I decided to dive into the world of coding, driven by a curiosity and passion for technology.
            My journey began with the basics, then I took classes at <a href="https://techfios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="no-style-link">
            Tech Fios
          </a>, which taught me backend development.
            By 2021, my dedication paid off, and I landed an internship at <a href="https://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="no-style-link">
            Home Depot
          </a>. After the internship, I was hired back on for 2 years as an entry-level developer. This opportunity 
          provided me with real-world experience and allowed me to further develop my skills.
            <br/><br/>
            In my free time, I love working out, a hobby that combines my skills for dedication and persistence. I also
            enjoy cooking and experimenting in the kitchen, finding new recipes and perfecting my skills. Balancing
            my professional and personal interests keeps me energized and motivated.

  Fast-forward to today, where I've been fortunate to work on a variety of projects. Each project has been a 
            stepping stone, helping me refine my skills and broaden my understanding of the field. I'm always eager to 
            learn and experiment with new technologies, staying up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements.
